The Official Jesse McConnell Game Coding Standard 1.0 Febuary 3, 2026

Objective:

    The objective of this coding standard is to balance keeping code human-readable 
    and intuitive with being concise and keeping as much logic onscreen as possible.
    
Priority:
    
    First, code should be computationally efficient. In no scenario does the standard
    trump performance and optimization. FastCode > CleanCode
    
    Second, code should be as readable and maintainable as possible whilst maintaining 
    performance.

Style:
 
    Case:
    
        GLOBAL_FUNCTIONS_OR_VARIABLES
        StaticFunctionsAndVariables
        MemberFunctionsAndVariables
        localVariables
        functionParameters
        
    Curly Braces:
    
        Curly braces *should* only be used on multiline scopes, including nested 
        scopes such as loops and if/else statements. This should at minimum be a
        refactor goal.
        
        (example)
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
            for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++)
                if (i == j)
                    if (moreThanOneLine == true)
                    {
                        j = 0;
                        DoStuff;
                    }
                    else
                        break;
                        
    Comments:
    
        Comments should be only for explaining: 
            - external frameworks/api usage
            - extremely complex scenarios
            
        Over comments, prioritize verbosity and concision. Especially with 
        non-predicate functions.
        
        (example)
        
            LongVerboseNamingConvention()
                        
    Spacing:
    
        Tab spacing should be 4 spaces.
        
        Lines in code *should* be broken up into some form of subjective grouping. 
        
        (example)   *** Comments here are to convey the principle of example and do not 
                    adhere to the coding standard.
        
        Class::Class()
        {
            // initialization of locals
            int someVar = 0;
            char SomeOtherVar = 'X';
            
            // struct creation
            MyStruct myStruct = {};
            myStruct.A = 1;
            myStruct.B = 2;
            myStruct.C = 7;
            
            // transitioning to logic or function calls
            DoStuff(myStruct.A, myStruct.B);
            DoStuff(myStruct.C, someVar);
            
            // beginning of scopes
            for (int i = 0; i < someVar; i++)
            {
                DoStuff(i + someVar);
                DoStuff(myStruct.A + myStruct.B);
            }
               
            // Etc.
           
    Type Inference:
        
        Avoid all type inference outside of handling unresolved objects (generics)
        or an even worse syntax.
            
        (example)
        
        use:
        
        for (auto& [handle, allocation] : AllocatedBuffers)
        {...
        
        instead of:
        
        for (std::unordered_map<uint64_t, BufferAllocation>::iterator it = AllocatedBuffers.begin(); it != AllocatedBuffers.end(); ++it)
        {...
         
        but do not use:
        
        int[] ints = []{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
        for (auto num : ints)
        {...
        
        use:
        
        for (int num : ints)
        {...
